# `Unpackr`

Unpackr is a vibes-based group trip recommendation app. We set out to rethink how users receive travel recommendations. Instead of the typical “where do you want to go?”, we flipped the concept:  

_You show us the suitcase that you packed (or want to pack) and we’ll tell you where you should go._

### ✨ Key Features

- **Upload your vibe**: Share one or more photos of your luggage, your favorite song, and a color palette. Then we’ll analyze the aesthetic and mood to suggest a matching travel destination.
- **Travel with friends**: Group-based recommendations let you plan trips together. All you need to do is create a group in our app and send the group code to your friends. Everyone in the group can submit their own photos, color palette and songs.
- **Live flight pricing**: Integrated with **Skyscanner's API** to get the cheapest flights from each group member’s location to the suggested destination.
- **Events around you**: Connected to **PredictHQ API** to show events happening at your destination during your travel dates.
- **Smart itinerary**: Everyone in the group can like or dislike each of the suggested activities, and we use that feedback to generate a personalized group travel plan.
- **User authentication**: The app has a login and user creation system.
- **Powered by Supabase**: Cloud-hosted database and backend services.
